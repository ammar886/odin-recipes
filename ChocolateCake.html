    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This moist chocolate stout cake with chocolate caramel frosting gains intensity and flavor from stout beer. It pairs beautifully with the rich, luscious chocolate-caramel frosting. Give yourself plenty of time to make this cake—it requires several hours of cooling time.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (11.2 ounce) bottle stout beer (such as Guinness™ )</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>Combine 1 1/2 cups white sugar, water, and corn syrup in a <br> light colored, tall-sided saucepan. Place pan over medium heat and <br> cook until mixture begins to turn a deep amber color, swirling pan <br> often to combine ingredients; about 15 minutes. Remove pan from heat and <br> carefully pour in heavy cream (mixture will bubble up rapidly <br> and then seize, this is ok). Place pan back over low heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Allow mixture to boil for 5 minutes, stirring constantly, then immediately pour caramel over the chocolate chips. Allow mixture to stand for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 (9-inch) round cake pans.</li>
    <li>Divide batter evenly between the 2 prepared cake pans. Tap pans on the counter several times to remove any larger air bubbles.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven and until the tops of the cakes spring back lightly when touched, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow cakes to cool in pans for 20 to 30 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.
